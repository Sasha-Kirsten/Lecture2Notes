        "This project aims to build a 'Video-to-Knowledge AI Agent'. This agent is designed to process video content by extracting audio for transcription, analyzing frames for visual information and text (OCR), and potentially using AWS services (S3, Transcribe, Rekognition, Bedrock) and other AI models (Groq's Whisper) to convert raw video data into structured, actionable knowledge. It also includes capabilities for web scraping with Firecrawl to enrich the extracted information."

        "We attempted transcription with Groq Whisper API first. The Groq client uses the Whisper large model to transcribe the audio; we requested plain text output for simplicity. If successful, this yields the transcript quickly without using any AWS resources (Groq’s service is free for our use-case). If it fails (e.g., API issues or audio too large >25MB), we catch the exception and switch to AWS Transcribe.\n",
        "\n",
        "For AWS Transcribe, we used the asynchronous job API. The job is started with the audio’s S3 URI and we poll until completion. Once done, we download the resulting JSON from S3. We then parse the JSON to extract the transcript text. This approach ensures we don’t overload the notebook with large responses, and Transcribe writes the output to S3 for us. We then clean and save the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The transcript text (cleaned) is uploaded to `transcripts/clean_transcript.txt` in S3 and also saved locally. The state is updated with the S3 path and a snippet of the text. Storing a snippet (e.g., first 1000 chars) in the state helps with quick verification without bloating the JSON. The status is updated to `\"transcribed\"`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using Groq by default helps conserve AWS free minutes. Amazon Transcribe’s free tier (if still applicable) covers the first hour per month, so either way this step should not incur cost for short videos. We now have the full video transcript ready for analysis."
